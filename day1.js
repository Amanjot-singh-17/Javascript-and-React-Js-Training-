// the introduction was discussed in the theory lecture
//the coding part is present in this file 

//the output can be generated in the following format:
//using console.log
console.log("first code as if hello world");
console.log(4);
console.log(2.14);


//the javascript variables can be created with the help of following keywords:
//const
//let
//var
 var name="amanjot singh";
 console.log(name);
 
 //it has redefination property
 name=5;
 console.log(name);
 
 //reassignment is possible
 var name="robina dogra is my teacher";
 console.log(name);

 
 //the let variable
 let assign="let variable created";
 console.log(assign);

 //it cant be redefined and throws error
 //let assign=1;      //error
 console.log(assign);

 //reassignment
 assign=1234567;
 console.log(assign);
 // its best practice to use let as compared to var


 //the const variable
 //used where constant variable is created

 //redefination and reassignment is not possible 
 //pi=4;                             error
 //const pi=3;                        error



 // the following are data types in javascript
 //number
 //string
//boolean
//undefined
//null or object
//bigint
